# Welcome

Frost Bot is the first and long awaited NodeJS library to come for Rust Console Edition servers, this is an amazing library to create your own applications which interact with your RCE community server!

## What can Frosty Bot do?

Frosty Bot gives you the ability to easily interact with G-PORTAL and read from the console as well as send commands to the console.

This means you can utilize such features to create all sorts of things, like:

* Kill Feed
* Quick Chat Commands
* Global Chat (Note Editing)

And of course you can use your imagination as a developer and create new and unique features to Rust Console community servers, the possibilities are endless!
