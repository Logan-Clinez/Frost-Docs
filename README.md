# Welcome

## What can RCE.JS do? <a href="#what-can-rce.js-do" id="what-can-rce.js-do"></a>

RCE.JS gives you the ability to easily interact with G-PORTAL and read from the console as well as send commands to the console.

This means you can utilize such features to create all sorts of things, like:

* Kill Feed
* Quick Chat Commands
* Global Chat (Note Editing)

And of course you can use your imagination as a developer and create new and unique features to Rust Console community servers, the possibilities are endless!
